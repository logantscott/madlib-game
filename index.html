            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth <span id="proper1" class="proper1 noun">Plageius</span> The <span id="adj1" class="adj">Wise</span>? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth <span id="proper1" class="proper1 noun"></span> was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. <span id="adv1" class="adv"></span>, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
